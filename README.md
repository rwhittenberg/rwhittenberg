- 👋 Hi, I’m @rwhittenberg. I am a father, husband, sibling, retired Air Force pilot, and--within 2 years--a retired software developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in Physics, Information Theory, Hyper-dimensional origins of the Big Bang, God/Jesus/Holy Spirit and promoting God's Kingdom.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be a better, more forgiving and understanding human being and to be more aware of the deceptive evils of big government.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that helps to end my career professionally and smoothly and at peace with all concerned.
- 📫 How to reach me: rwhittenberg@lookingglasscyber.com (but try not to unless you want to talk about things in item 2 above.).
